                    <p>
                        This module is supposed to provide support for validating almost any form. Based on the form, and validation rules that can be defined for each field, it should return all fields that pass the validation and if the form is valid or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It also includes printing messages below invalid fields and adding a class to invalid fields.

                    <p>
                        All you need to do is import the module, which defines the validation function and helper functions for generating validation rules. With that, you are all set to validate any form on your website! ðŸŽ‰

                        Out of the box methods that generate validation rules strings for so you don't have to remember them all and you can define validation for each field in seconds!

                    <p>
                        It provides the set of pre-defined validation messages that will be printed out below your validation fields signaling where validation failed exactly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can also define your own messages for each field and each validation rule separately.
